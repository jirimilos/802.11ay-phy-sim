# 802.11ay-phy-sim
This repository contains the baseband model of the IEEE 802.11ay physical layer (PHY) simulator created in MATLAB 2017b on the level of m-files. It only supports the Single Carrier PHY (SC-PHY) specification. To run this simulator, the following MATLAB toolboxes are required: Control System Toolbox, Signal Processing Toolbox, DSP System Toolbox and Communications System Toolbox. 

All m-files are made entirely by the authors of the simulator. Otherwise, inner functions of the program MATLAB are used.

If the use of this simulator leads to a scientific publication, please, cite our work:
